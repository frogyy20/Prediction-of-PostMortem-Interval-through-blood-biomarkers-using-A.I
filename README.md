# Prediction-of-PostMortem-Interval-through-blood-biomarkers-using-A.I

In forensic investigations, determining the postmortem interval (PMI) or time of death is crucial. A  forensic examiner's ability to accurately estimate the PMI is crucial.In order determine the cause of  death and investigation of suspicious death which all are the part of forensics, We develop a device with the principle of Artificial Intelligence. Due to the use of AI, many tasks related to forensics can  be automated such as forensic report generation, evaluation of different metabolites in blood
and urine, fingerprints matching, etc.
